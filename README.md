## CMU Rental Hub

A smart rental management system designed for **Central Michigan University (CMU)** students to **borrow and manage campus resources efficiently**.  
The platform helps students rent essential items like monitors, projectors, chairs, and appliances â€” while allowing the university to reuse existing resources and reduce waste.

## Project Overview

Many students, especially newcomers, need temporary items during their stay at the university. At the same time, the campus has unused furniture and equipment that could be shared.  
The **CMU Rental Hub** bridges this gap by offering a **centralized digital platform** where:

- **Students** can view and rent available items for short periods  
- **Administrators** can manage inventory, rentals, and update item details  

This project was developed as part of the **BIS 698 â€“ Information Systems Project** course at **Central Michigan University**.

## Features

**Two Interfaces**
- **Student Portal:** Browse, search, and rent available items  
- **Admin Panel:** Add, update, and track inventory efficiently  

**Database Management**
- All item details (name, description, quantity, price, and availability) stored in **SQL Server**

**User-Friendly Design**
- Clean Python-based GUI (Tkinter) and simple HTML/CSS interface  

**Data Handling**
- Uses **CSV/Excel/MS Access** for uploading and managing data that syncs with SQL Server  

**Agile Development**
- Built iteratively with continuous feedback and improvement  


## Tech Stack
